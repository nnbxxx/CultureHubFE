                  week was a long-awaited and highly anticipated return to our
                  roots! We saw presentations from higher ed faculty and admins
                  sharing their recommended best practices for using Kahoot! in
                  your courses. They detail their first-hand experience
                  reviewing course content, assessing knowledge, and fostering
                  discussion with Kahoot!. So, with exam season right around the
                  corner, there’s no better time to get up to date on our latest
                  features and updates to try out with your students!

                  For our 10th anniversary of making learning awesome, Sean
                  D’Arcy, VP of Kahoot! at School, highlighted how far we’ve
                  come since our humble beginnings as a university project.
                  Attendees got a look at higher ed faculty favorites, including
                  word cloud, open-ended, and brainstorm question types, as well
                  as our newest question types, drop pin, slider, and 6 answer
                  options for quizzes and polls! And that was only the
                  beginning! We’re excited to introduce so many new ways of
                  creating interactive learning experiences with Student Passes,
                  giving students access to the Kahoot! Creator, and engaging
                  study modes, encouraging student knowledge sharing in and out
                  of the classroom. Plus student-led game modes, and Kahoot!
                  courses that allow instructors to add multiple kahoots,
                  videos, PDFs, and other resources into full courses that can
                  be hosted live, assigned to students, or studied at their own
                  pace.

                  Our most recent project, Kahoot! for Brands was also
                  announced, making it possible for faculty and admins to add
                  their higher ed institutions’ unique branding into all kahoots
                  hosted on campus! We’re so thankful for the constant support
                  from the higher ed community over the past 10 years with over
                  97% of the global top 500 universities using Kahoot!, and over
                  82% of those with upgraded Kahoot! EDU or Kahoot!+ accounts.
                  That’s a lot of awesome learning happening around the world!

                  As a Professor of Education at McKendree University, Dr. Julie
                  Tronsing-Meyer’s students are future teachers learning about
                  how to effectively teach lesson content. Dr. Tronsing-Meyer
                  discusses her research-based teaching practices and how ISTE
                  standards and the constructivist teaching theory support the
                  use of Kahoot! for effective learning. In practice with her
                  undergraduate students, she found that using Kahoot! was a
                  great way to support active learning because her students
                  learn through experience, social discourse, and collaboration.
                  Finally, Julie gives us her tips and tricks for using Kahoot!
                  in her courses and shares feedback from her students, who
                  said, “Kahoot! makes me feel confident to participate in the
                  activity”.

                  the Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences. Kurt talked
                  us through his experiences using Kahoot! not only as an
                  instructor but also as a student himself! He discusses how
                  Kahoot! aided in his professional growth and how he brought
                  his learnings with him as a faculty leader, helping to
                  implement technology and exploring how to keep curriculum
                  relevant in the future of AI, machine learning, and the fourth
                  industrial revolution. Kurt shared from his own experience and
                  the opinion of his students, that there was an observable
                  improvement in their achievement and performance as Kahoot!
                  increased knowledge retention, collaboration, and helped them
                  take a more structured approach to assessment.

                  of incorporating Kahoot! questions throughout classroom
                  content, encouraging students to constantly apply themselves
                  by including PowerPoint slides and videos interwoven with
                  polls, word clouds, and puzzles that optimize lessons for
                  student attention spans. To really lock in the learning,
                  Jennifer creates lightning rounds to repeat any difficult
                  questions that came up in the lesson with less time to answer
                  and worth more points! Now that’s a recipe for engaging
                  learning that her students loved so much, they even shared the
                  experience on social media!
